# Restaurant Database Management System

A complete database management solution designed for a restaurant, developed for the **Database Systems** course.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a fully functional relational database system for a restaurant. It covers:

- Requirement gathering
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) design
- Relational schema creation
- SQL implementation using MySQL

The system supports core restaurant operations such as tracking orders, managing customers and employees, handling menu items, and processing transactions.

# Features

- Defined user and business requirements
- Designed ERD and mapped to relational schema
- Implemented:
  - **DDL** (Data Definition Language) to create tables and relationships
  - **DML** (Data Manipulation Language) to populate and query data
- Ensures referential integrity and efficient data normalization

# Technologies Used

- **MySQL** for database implementation
- **SQL** for querying and transaction handling

# Deliverables

- `ERD.pdf`: Diagram of the entity relationships
- `schema.sql`: Full DDL script to create the database
- `sample_queries.sql`: DML queries for data insertion and retrieval
- `report.pdf`: Documentation outlining requirements, design, and implementation

# Learning Outcomes

- Practical experience in database design and implementation
- Applied understanding of normalization, constraints, and transactions
- Development of a real-world SQL-based solution
